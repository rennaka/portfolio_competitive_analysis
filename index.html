			<td class="#"><img src="images/The Netherlands.jpg"> The Netherlands</td>
			<td class="#">Very minimal design, Very nice color contrast, Diverse blend of design capabilities. </td>
			<td class="#">Portfolio organization is very simple, and easily understandable.    </td>
			<td class="#">Tons of subtle hover overs, with good relevant data.  For example changing font size.  Also incorperates this java-timer which self lowers the landing page to the body of the site, which is a feature I would like to explore in my portfolio.</td>
			<td class="#">The information about the page is organized very well and does not overwhelm the end user with hidden pages.  No feeling of getting lost.</td>

			<td class="#"><a href="http://en.ten2.tw/works" target="_blank">Tenten Creative</a></td>
			<td class="#"><img src="images/Taiwan.jpg"> Taiwan </td>
			<td class="#">A very honest and simple layout design.  </td>
			<td class="#">This portfolio uses a very good template for showing their web design works.  The layout chosen for this site to display the sites is my personal favorite.  Another note is that the page load time was extremely fast.</td>
			<td class="#">The amount of interactivity used for this page is relatively low, but the color contrast between red and white make for a nice blend.  Since this portfolio leans more towards a minimalist layout, I would not see how they would incorperate high level of movement. </td>
			<td class="#">Since the navigation within this page follows a minimal model, I feel like it is impossible to get lost within their page.  This portfolio would be something that I would consider in my own portfolio for future webdesign projects.</td>

			<td class="#"><a href="http://www.mastersofwebdesign.com/portfolio/portfolio-webdesign.html" target="_blank">Masters of Web Design </a></td>
			<td class="#"><img src="images/The Netherlands.jpg"> The Netherlands</td>
			<td class="#">Masters of Web Design contains a very clean, professional look that is not pretentious but very friendly.  </td>
			<td class="#">The <b>typeface</b> allows for a very easy read, also has a very good color contrast which adds to the friendiness of the page.  </td>
			<td class="#">Very subtle shape change in main navigation, as well as text color changes in sub navigations.</td>
			<td class="#">Very clear, objective navigation within this page.  Fixed sub navigation on right side remains fixed while navigating through the site which makes it easy to get find your way around their page.  The footer content seems a little out of place with the choice of color and input fields.</td>

			<td class="#"><a href="http://www.bluefountainmedia.com/portfolio/websites target="_blank">Blue Fountain Media - New York City</a></td>
			<td class="#"><img src="images/America.jpg"> America</td>
			<td class="#">This website portfolio a highly informative and professional look and feel.  The wide variety of websites done from designer tweezers to obesity to vitamin water demonstrate the diversity in their design.</td>
			<td class="#">Page load time is very quick considering the amount of content that they have.  A very nice hover feature over the images that sample their work.  This page depicts three example rows which is pretty standard within the "fixed" portfolio layout.</td>
			<td class="#">Sub navigation includes filters by industry and filters by design.  They also include a very nicely made video animation illustrating some of the different sites that they have made. </td>
			<td class="#">Main navigation bar clearly depicts my experience on this site.  However, the functionality in sub navigation gives off a little bit more of a confusing sensation which took a little while for me to get used to.  They fail amazingly if the end user wished to view the footer due to this auto-loading feature that forces the user to see more of their website examples.</td>

			<td class="#"><a href="http://www.chinaclick.com.cn/portfolio/index.htm" target="_blank">China Click</a></td>
			<td class="#"><img src="images/PRC.jpg"> People's Republic of China</td>
			<td class="#">Very professional, serious and to the point.  Very analytical descriptions.</td>
			<td class="#">Since the amount of text on this website is on the heavier side, I feel like this congests the design/artistic capabilites.  To me, this site over ellaborates on details, without enough open real estate I feel should be there to make the website easier to read and negotiate.</td>
			<td class="#">The only interactivity that I found was the hover feature in their navigation bars.  They do include the option to view the site in Mandarin, however, this clicks through to an entirely different website all togetherâ€¦Which I cannot understand.</td>
			<td class="#">This page contains a very large amount of information talking about the various clients and projects that they have taken on.  Their work and client list agrees with the type of branding that this firm has.  The large amount of pages created a sort of boring look, sight, and feel when navigating throughout their portfolio.</td>

			<td class="#"><a href="http://www.mikihiko.com/" target="_blank">Mikihiko Kyobashi (Photographer Portfolio)</a></td>
			<td class="#"><img src="images/Japan.jpg"> Japan</td>
			<td class="#">A very ambigious, experimental website design, tons of embedded video, automatic movement, very pretentious site design.</td>
			<td class="#">Very difficult to learn this outline, it is hard to navigate because the navigation teleports the end user around in such an interesting way.</td>
			<td class="#">This site is hyper-interactive.  In other words, there is more motion and unpredictable video that an older data connection or computer will not be able to render.  Also featured this weird ominous sound that is impossible to turn off.</td>
			<td class="#">Due to the experimental nature of this page, the designer makes the content very jagged or un-fluid-like.  Long introduction load time which tells end user that they can use "arrows" to navigate which turns out to be a very inefficent way to navigate through the site.</td>

			<td class="#"><a href="http://www.pakistanwebdesign.com/webdesign_portfolio.html" target="_blank">Web Design</a></td>
			<td class="#"><img src="images/Pakistan.jpg"> Pakistan</td>
			<td class="#">This portfolio seems rather bland, and emotionless.</td>
			<td class="#">This designer does an effective jobs showing off what they know.  Based on what I know about website design (which is not very much), I feel like this site was done a little older, and does not contain any newer features to make the site more dynamic.  After reviewing the source code, I learned that they used tables to program their page. </td>
			<td class="#">Very fast page load time.  The only interactivity I was able to find was an input form in their Contact us page.  </td>
			<td class="#">The navigation bar on the top kept a strong inventory of the pages that were able to visit.  On the other hand, they had a very confusing sitemap that was not very representative of the pages that were on the navigation bar.</td>

			<td class="#"><a href="http://www.ethiopiawebdesign.com/web-design.html" target="_blank">Ethiopia Web Design</a></td>
			<td class="#"><img src="images/Ethiopia.jpg"> Ethiopia</td>
			<td class="#">Friendly, honest, and clean are some of the adjectives that I thought of when it came to the branding of this designer.</td>
			<td class="#">Very objective, yet minimal execution of this page.  Site portfolio did not contain any photographs or image samples of pages created, but rather text and hyperlinks.  They did contain a friendly warning in parentheticals that "This page will open in a new window" which I found to be very courteous.</td>
			<td class="#">A very old fashioned website, having traveled to Pakistan and now Ethiopia to analyze web designers, I would like to travel back to the western world next to see what new ideas I can find towards interactivity.</td>
			<td class="#">The navigation on this page utilizes a color combination which makes for a very soft visualization of content and data.  Since the the interactivity presented in the navigation is rather minimal it is not hard to find your way around most of the pages.  On the other hand I did notice on the bottom links to other pages that were not really present or availible on the main navigation bar.</td>

			<td class="#"><a href="http://netway-media.com/portfolio" target="_blank">Net-Way Media</a></td>
			<td class="#"><img src="images/Germany.jpg"> Germany</td>
			<td class="#">Honest, knowledgeable, minimalist feel this is a developer that markets themselves as familiar on many platforms.</td>
			<td class="#">This portfolio does effective job displaying their examples.  However, the oversized header image seemed to overwhelm  the rest of the website, where the actual content resided.  In addition this large header hindered their page load time.  The developer did not include any annotation in regards to how many projects they created which made me feel a little lost.</td>
			<td class="#">This website remains rather static, with the exception of the arrows to view the next portfolio, and a Twitter data feed box on the right.</td>
			<td class="#">Once I was able to negotiate around the oversized header, I was able to effectively navigate throughout the site.  Aside from viewing the examples of the portfolio, I did not feel like I got lost, or was missing content or pages.</td>

			<td class="#"><img src="images/America.jpg"> America</td>
			<td class="#">A very kind and simple website, one that probably is best situated for grandmothers and young children.  </td>
			<td class="#">The method to switch through to the next design ideas gives the end user a feeling of difficulty when they only allot tiny squares that requires the user to hover over. This made this portfolio especially irritating when trying to view examples of their work.</td>
			<td class="#">Interactivity remains relatively low within this design portfolio.  Again, referring back to this site only containing the hover over without any cleaner alternatives for site navigation makes this page very difficult to negotiate with.</td>
			<td class="#">By creating the only findable method to navigate mousing over very little squares with no arrows or chronology makes it very difficult to see what is really going on.  They also do not have click-throughs to larger images of the website or to open the actual website they made into a new window.  Perhaps if your web design clients pay money for SEO, maybe it is not a bad idea to give your clients a little site traffic?</td>
